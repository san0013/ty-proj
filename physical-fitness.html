    <h2>Components of Physical Fitness</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cardiovascular Endurance:</strong> The ability of the heart and lungs to supply oxygen during sustained physical activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Muscular Strength:</strong> The amount of force a muscle can produce in a single effort.</li>
        <li><strong>Muscular Endurance:</strong> The ability of a muscle to sustain repeated contractions over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The range of motion available at a joint.</li>
        <li><strong>Body Composition:</strong> The ratio of fat to lean mass in the body.</li>
    </ul>
